Last month, the [Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI)](https://hai.stanford.edu/) introduced the [Center for Research on Foundation Models](https://crfm.stanford.edu/). Most of these models are typically known as large language models such as GPT-3 and BERT. Today I gave a lecture at [SPL](https://spl.ce.sharif.edu/) on the technological foundations which is the fifth section of this report. This section is quite long to read but I have summarised the key points. You can find the slides [from here](https://github.com/Sharif-SLPL/Lectures/blob/main/2021-09-21/Foundation%20Models%20-%20Technological%20Foundations.pdf).
