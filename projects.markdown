# AI Projects & Publications
Here is a list of the research projects (in AI) that I have published:

* Transformer as a Regression Model for Fine-Grained Scoring of Textual Semantic Relations
<p class="more-desc">This paper and the accompanying code were utilized in the 18th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2024) for the task of automatically detecting the degree of semantic relatedness between pairs of sentences.</p>

* A Transformer-Based Approach to Detect Machine Generated Text 
<p class="more-desc">This paper and the respective code were utilized in the 18th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2024) for the task of detecting machine-generated text.</p>
<div class="badge-container"><span class="badge pink"><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11774">paper</a></span>
<span class="badge purple"><a href="https://github.com/Sharif-SLPL/Sharif-MGTD">code</a></span></div>

* Persian Formality Style Transfer
<p class="more-desc">This project was done as my Master's thesis which involved a model trained in an unsupervised fashion to convert informal Persian into its formal equivalent.</p>

* Persian Paraphrase Generation
<p class="more-desc">A T5 model for generating paraphrases of Persian sentences. Trained on the Tapaco dataset.</p>

* Supervised Sentiment Analysis on Tweets
<p class="more-desc">A class project to classify a sample data-set of 1200 tweets to either positive or negative class, based on the type of words used in those tweet.</p>

* Unsupervised News Article Clustering
<p class="more-desc">This project aims to cluster a news data-set to one of the four classes which are: Sports, Economics, Politics, and Culture using K-Means & Mixture Models in Python. The data-set is crawled from Tasnim News Agency and the crawler used for this task is written in Julia language.</p>

* Product Review Classification
<p class="more-desc">In this project I used deep learning on a data-set from Digikala, an Iranian E-commerce to correctly label the review of customers over a range of products and whether they recommend it or not, or if they are unsure about it.</p>

* Supervised Movie Classification
<p class="more-desc">The goal of this project is to classify the genre of movies by their plots. 4000 documents were used to train the current model. Data-set used for this task was obtained from Kaggle.</p>

* Neural Speech Synthesis with Transformer Network      
<p class="more-desc">This project was done for the Speech Processing course which used Mozila's Common Voices dataset (due to the lack of available audio in Persian) as the source to train a transformer network to synthesize Persian speech.</p>
