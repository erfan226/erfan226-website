<h2 class="post-list-heading">Who am I?</h2>
I am Erfan (Karim) Akhavan. I pursued my Master's in Computational Linguistics from Sharif University of Technology (SUT), with [Dr. Hossein Sameti](http://sharif.edu/~sameti/) as my supervisor. My focus of study was Persian language style transfer. I completed my BA in English Language and Literature from the University of Guilan in September 2019.

<h2>My Stack</h2>
I Code in Python, PHP, Javascript, and Bash. My focus is on Automation, Web Services, and AI (esp. NLP).

<p style="margin-top: 20px">Beginning my journey with web application development, I gained experience with HTML, CSS, and later, JavaScript. After gaining more familiarity with the language, I became acquainted with modern JavaScript libraries such as ReactJS, and began working on various projects, including a prototype of an educational game that taught coding to children. </p>
<p>As I am more oriented towards logical thinking, in 2016 I decided to shift my focus to back-end development, learning PHP and coding WordPress plugins and themes, followed by Python (Django & Flask). Since then, I have held numerous roles and worked on various freelance projects with Python. My attraction to Artificial Intelligence and its automation capabilities ultimately led me to pursue a Masterâ€™s in Computational Linguistics in 2019, utilizing Python to explore research projects in Natural Language Processing.
</p>
<p>My enthusiasm remains strongly in line with developing web services that can offer a vast range of features to end-users.
