<h2 class="post-list-heading">Who am I?</h2>
I am Erfan (Karim) Akhavan, a Software Developer specializing in Web Development (Django) and NLP; passionate about pushing technology to its boundaries and bringing new ideas to life! I enjoy creating web services that provide an extensive variety of functions to users, especially those provided by Artificial Intelligence. I am flexible in learning new technologies and enjoy collaborating with people who like continuous learning and tackling challenges.
I pursued my Master's in Computational Linguistics from Sharif University of Technology (SUT), with [Dr. Hossein Sameti](http://sharif.edu/~sameti/) as my supervisor. My focus of the study was style transfer in Persian language. Before that, I completed my BA in English Language and Literature from the University of Guilan in September 2019.

<h2>My Stack</h2>

* Languages: I Code in Python, PHP, Javascript, and Bash
* IDE: VS Code & PyCharm (Does CLI count as IDE? Well, it should...)
*  Frameworks: Django, Flask, and PyTorch
Databases: MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB (rarely)

<h2 class="post-list-heading">My Path</h2>

<p style="margin-top: 20px">Beginning my journey with web application development, I gained experience with HTML, CSS, and later, JavaScript. After gaining more familiarity with the language, I became acquainted with modern JavaScript libraries such as ReactJS and began working on various projects, including a prototype of an educational game that taught coding to children. </p>
<p>As I am more oriented towards logical thinking, in 2016 I decided to shift my focus to back-end development, learning PHP and coding WordPress plugins and themes, followed by Python (Django & Flask). Since then, I have held numerous roles and worked on various freelance projects with Python. My attraction to Artificial Intelligence and its automation capabilities ultimately led me to pursue a Masterâ€™s in Computational Linguistics in 2019, utilizing Python to explore research projects in Natural Language Processing.
</p>
<p>My enthusiasm remains strongly in line with developing web services that can offer a vast range of features to end-users.
