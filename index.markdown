<h2 class="post-list-heading">Who am I?</h2>
I am Erfan (Karim) Akhavan, a Software Developer specializing in Web Development (Django) and NLP; passionate about pushing technology to its boundaries and bringing new ideas to life! I enjoy creating web services that provide an extensive variety of functions to users, especially those provided by Artificial Intelligence. I am flexible in learning new technologies and enjoy collaborating with people who like continuous learning and tackling challenges.
I pursued my Master's in Computational Linguistics from Sharif University of Technology (SUT), with [Dr. Hossein Sameti](http://sharif.edu/~sameti/) as my supervisor. My focus of the study was style transfer in Persian language. Before that, I completed my BA in English Language and Literature from the University of Guilan in September 2019.
