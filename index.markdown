<h2 class="post-list-heading">Who am I?</h2>
I pursued my Master's in Computational Linguistics from Sharif University of Technology (SUT), with [Dr. Hossein Sameti](http://sharif.edu/~sameti/) as my supervisor. My focus of study was Persian language style transfer. I completed my BA in English Language and Literature from the University of Guilan in September 2019.
